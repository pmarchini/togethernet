TogetherNet is a platform for the sharing of Wifi networks, that allows commercial activities to have greater visibility thanks to a system of notifications and personalized advertising directed to community users who need a wifi internet network.
TogetherNet is supported by AlmaCube, the Incubator of the University of Bologna with Unindustria Bologna.

In our cities we are surrounded by Internet hotspots, often not used fully and at the same time. Most of these hotspots are private and closed. In addition, they are often superimposed. Walking through the cities, it is usual today to get up to 20 hotspots, which can not be accessed. The management of internet networks is for these reasons very inefficient. This inefficiency leads to problems of electromagnetic pollution (superimposed hotspots). Furthermore, the effects of a high number of wi-fi networks on human health are not yet clear. TogetherNet's goal is to create a management of internet networks more efficient, optimized and sustainable in our cities.

TogheterNet team developed an application that allows the sharing of both public and private WiFi networks. Through this application the user does not need to write the password of the network, in fact the connection will be automatic for all the networks that will be registered in the TogetherNet community. In addition, all user activities are directly recorded on the account in order to protect the host that lends the network. When a new network is added to the community, the password is saved with an encryption key preserving the privacy of the host.

In this stage, TogetherNet offers its services in particular to commercial activities such as bars, hotels, restaurants and retail stores. These activities will find TN a useful instrument to share wi-fi to their clients, ensuring security and manage password and privacy. Moreover they will have other important benefits from sharing internet using TN such as free advertising spots and visibility in the app.
